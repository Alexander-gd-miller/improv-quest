Improv Quest: The Theatrical Adventure! 

A news presenter will narrate the overarching story - the characters acclaim, wealth and other life style elements. News represents breaks between play 

Here's how it works:

The presenter will : 
3. Players receive a deck of acting cards, which contain scenes, monologues, and improvisation prompts.
4. There's a set of quest cards, which outline challenges like "Win the Best Actor Award" or "Perform a Shakespearean Play."
5. Each player also gets a set of dice and a prop bag containing random props.

1. **Props**: Each player selects a prop from a pile. These props could be anything from a hat to a toy car. Use the prop as the primary basis of your character. 

Pick a news presenter 

2. **News**: the news presenter will lead the back story using a random current event or headline that must be woven into the players story. 

3. **Wikipedia**: Players take 2 turns on Wikipedia. They then have to find an article related to the news topic corresponding to the number they rolled and incorporate it as an expert. 


**Setup:**
1. Each player makes a character card, which determines their starting abilities and special talents.
2. The empty game board represents different theaters, studios, and locations where performances take place.
3. Players receive a deck of acting cards, which contain scenes, monologues, and improvisation prompts.
4. There's a set of dice and a prop bag containing random props.

**Setup:**
1. Gather a group of players, each equipped with a "me" card (faced card) and a wallet of general cards to spend to act out news or history. 
2. Assign a journalist role to one player. This player will moderate the game, introducing scenarios based on historical events or current news topics.

**Objective:** Players take on the roles of actors trying to win the coveted title of "Master Performer" by completing various acting challenges and quests. The game board represents different theaters, studios, and locations where performances take place. Other players act as judges, rating the performance based on criteria like emotion, delivery, and creativity.

**Gameplay:**
1. The journalist draws a scenario card and reads the headline based on a historical event or current news topic. Then they set a fake objective by quizzing the players.
2. Each player is dealt a "me" card and requests “me” cards to act for the scenario.
3. The journalist provides a brief overview of the scenario using Wikipedia or other sources as reference.
4. Players then have a set time (e.g., 2 minutes) to improvise a scene based on the scenario, incorporating elements from their "me" cards, and spending them on each other to collaborate on the scene. They act out the hand for fame, with the journalist 
 introducing the next scenario, until they conclude by calling in news and reporters. 
5. After each improvisation, a journalist updates the news narrative based on the performances, rewarding outstanding performances and providing constructive feedback for improvement.
6. Players judge each other openly, discussing who they believe portrayed the scenario most effectively.
7. The journalist determines the winner of the scenario based on performance quality, adherence to the scenario, and audience judgment.
8. The winner of the scenario keeps the scenario card as a point in their hand.
9. To lose, players must act their last "me" card, in the subsequent round.
10. Repeat steps 1-9 for multiple rounds, with the journalist introducing new scenarios and updating the news narrative accordingly.
